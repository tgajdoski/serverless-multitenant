## Deploying to AWS

Run `npm install` to make sure dependencies are updated

Run `sls deploy` to upload the product to the API Gateway

## When do you need to update autogenerated stuff?

- When you change the graphql (.gql) schemas, run `npm run graphl2ts` to build typscript interfaces based on the schema
- When you change the DynamoDb table, use DynoDB module, to generate typescript Data Level Access class

TODO: We need to somehow define principles of automatic generation of those two

## Running tests on CI

npm test

*all the tests are currently deactived, there is just one default test which will pass*
